  \class o_LabelImage o_LabelImage.h
  \brief Is a (parent class of) o_CPicture<long>. The pixel values are
	interpreted as label numbers (or values)

  The class handles different means of creating label images from binary 
  images. After The label image has been created, several methods exist to
  examine the labelel regions.

  1. The method InitRegions() builds up an internal list with objects of from 
  the class o_Region. Currently there is no incrementel update possible! If 
  a new label is added to the label image or some regions are changed a call 
  to InitRegions() must be done. On destruction of a o_LabelImage object all
  associated region objects are deleted !
  
  2. The method FillNeighborList() fills an array of std::list<long*> with a list of neighbors labels
  for each region. Usage Recommended !
